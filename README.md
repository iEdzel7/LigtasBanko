Phishing attacks are one of the biggest threats to online banking security since 
the Philippines has a high level of internet usage, but relatively low levels of computer 
literacy. To overcome this challenge, the LigtasBanko system was created, it used 
deep learning and auxiliary tools for the detection of phishing threats. This research 
involved the collection of benign Philippine banking URLs using JavaScript and 
phishing URLs from the PhishTank database that acted as the dataset to train and test 
the proposed model. Three deep learning algorithms, CNN, DNN, and RNN-LSTM 
were used, and the best algorithm was CNN, which had an accuracy of nearly 99%.  

The system’s features included an Email PwN Checker to alert users of 
breached email accounts, a Website Blocker to restrict access to phishing URLs, 
Selenium for dynamic website verification, and a Chatbot powered by Groq AI for 
real-time assistance and user education. These tools collectively enhanced user 
protection and awareness, creating a comprehensive solution for phishing detection. 
Evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices and precision-recall scores validated 
the system’s reliability and robustness. Survey results demonstrated that 96.6% of 
users felt more secure using online banking with the system’s support. The integration 
of deep learning and auxiliary tools enhanced cybersecurity awareness and promoted 
safer online banking behaviors. The LigtasBanko system demonstrated a scalable, 
reliable approach to combating phishing, with potential for broader use and ongoing 
improvements to address emerging cybersecurity challenges.
